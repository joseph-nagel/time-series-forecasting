# Time series forecasting

This repository contains simple time series forecasting examples.
Synthetic experiments are conducted where different models are trained on the same toy dataset.
This includes classical **autoregressive moving-average** (ARMA) models as well as more modern
**long short-term memory** (LSTM) and **temporal convolutional network** (TCN) models.
All of these approaches leverage powerful mechanisms for sequence modeling.
