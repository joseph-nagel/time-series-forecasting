# Time series forecasting

This repository contains simple time series forecasting examples.
A synthetic experiment is conducted where both a **long short-term memory** (LSTM) and
a **temporal convolutional network** (TCN) model are trained on the same toy dataset.
They establish powerful mechanisms for sequence modeling.
